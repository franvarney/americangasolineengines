				My name is Andrew Albrecht and I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. In the mid 90s, I became interested in hit and miss gasoline engines when a coworker introduced them to me at a farm show. Since then, I have collected about 15 engines and 4 marine type boat engines. I also have a few pieces of farm equipment including a corn sheller, corn grinder, and a large water pump and I also make reproduction parts for Magnetos which I sell mainly to Mark's Magneto Repair Service.
				<br />
				<br />
				Here are a few photos of my collection. All are running engines and working equipment.
				The John Deere engine was a repaint only and the John Deere Corn Sheller was a complete restoration.
